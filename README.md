# LSS_Shop_Prototype

## Objectives:
Welcome to the Lenovo Summer School Shop Prototype!

This project was created as a follow-up of the **2025 Lenovo Summer School** and serves multiple purposes:

- To apply the knowledge and skills gained during the program
- And most importantly, to **foster collaboration among LSS 2025 participants**, encouraging teamwork across 3 departments: **Frontend, Backend and DevOps**, trying to follow the Agile principles.

Our goal is to simulate real-world software development by promoting **cross-functional teamwork**, shared responsibility, and effective communication in a practical setting.

> **Note:** While this project is currently focused on internal collaboration among LSS participants, we may consider opening it up to external contributors in the future.

> In the meantime, feel free to fork the repository and propose changes â€” we'd be happy to review and discuss them with our team. Thank you!

## Project overview ðŸ˜„:

At this stage, the main features we aim to include in the project are:

- Building a simple landing page in Angular, applying best practices learned during the Summer School.
- Setting up a MongoDB database to store product details.
- Developing backend logic to connect the landing page with the database, enabling data retrieval and storage.
- Embedding a basic Google Map showing the Lenovo HQ location in Bucharest.


## In short, what we want to create at this moment?ðŸ¤”

Our project focuses on creating a simple landing page for internal Lenovo merchandise like bracelets, sunglasses, tote bags etc. The main goal is to promote these products and maybe even market them later on.

We are building this using Angular, which helps us keep the page efficient and easy to manage. On the page, each item's photo will come with key details like its name, price, material, size and current stock. All these products details are stored in a MongoDB database behind the scenes.

We are also developing the backend logic to connect the landing page to the database, so it can easily get and store all the product information, ensuring everything runs smoothly. And, as a neat touch, we're including a basic Google Map right on the page, showing the Lenovo HQ location in Bucharest.


## Future Features ðŸ˜„:

Following the development of the initial MVP/prototype, several additional features could be explored to enhance the project further:

- Develop basic user account functionality, including authentication and profile handling.
- Implement the backend logic for managing multiple Lenovo locations, allowing automatic map rendering based on the selected city.
- Introduce fun and engaging minigames on separate pages, where users could win small prizes or just enjoy the experience.
- Strengthen the overall security of the application, especially before moving to production.
- Deploy the project live â€” and hopefully, keep it online and hack-free! ðŸ˜„
