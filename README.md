# LSS_Shop_Prototype

## Objectives:
Welcome to the Lenovo Summer School Shop Prototype!

This project was created as a follow-up of the **2025 Lenovo Summer School** and serves multiple purposes:

- To apply the knowledge and skills gained during the program
- And most importantly, to **foster collaboration among LSS 2025 participants**, encouraging teamwork across 3 departments: **Frontend, Backend and DevOps**, trying to follow the Agile principles.

Our goal is to simulate real-world software development by promoting **cross-functional teamwork**, shared responsibility, and effective communication in a practical setting.

> **Note:** While this project is currently focused on internal collaboration among LSS participants, we may consider opening it up to external contributors in the future.

> In the meantime, feel free to fork the repository and propose changes â€” we'd be happy to review and discuss them with our team. Thank you!

## Project overview ðŸ˜„:

At this stage, the main features we aim to include in the project are:

- Building a simple landing page in Angular, applying best practices learned during the Summer School.
- Setting up a MongoDB database to store product details.
- Developing backend logic to connect the landing page with the database, enabling data retrieval and storage.
- Embedding a basic Google Map showing the Lenovo HQ location in Bucharest.


## Future Features :

Following the development of the initial MVP/prototype, several additional features could be explored to enhance the project further:

- Develop basic user account functionality, including authentication and profile handling.
- Implement the backend logic for managing multiple Lenovo locations, allowing automatic map rendering based on the selected city.
- Introduce fun and engaging minigames on separate pages, where users could win small prizes or just enjoy the experience.
- Strengthen the overall security of the application, especially before moving to production.
- Deploy the project live â€” and hopefully, keep it online and hack-free! ðŸ˜„
